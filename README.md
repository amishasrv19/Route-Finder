# Route-Finder
This project will help the user to visit their favorite places within the shortest period of time by providing them with the best possible path available in the best time complexity.
ALGORITHMS:
The program follows algorithms of Floyd Warshell (Dynamic Programming), and Time Scheduling (Greedy Algorithm). 
The Floyd Warshell algorithm is used for locating the best possible path to the destination point. In this algorithm, the graph storing the weights(distance) between two nodes(two places) is processed to find the shortest path for all the destinations to reach from the source node. 
The time Scheduling algorithm is used for the places that are time bound for visiting places that you want to visit before they get closed.

OPTIONS IN THE MENU:
Find the best path from source to destination:
If chosen this, the user is asked to enter their source location and the destination location from the provided map(graph) and the Floyd warshell algorithm will find the best path possible.
Find the best path to visit all the destinations you want:
If the user chooses this, they will be asked for the starting destination and will get the path in which they have to travel the least and visit all the places available.
Visit maximum places (time-bound):
This feature of the program allows the user to visit all the places before they get closed.
