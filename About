Introduction
In this project, I made a user-friendly C++ Program to implement a route finder. The program has features like 
●	finding the best possible path to a destination, 
●	finding the best way to cover given destinations, 
●	visiting all given places, 
●	covering maximum possible number of destinations when the places are time bound,

This project will help the user to visit their favourite places within the shortest period of time by providing them with the best possible path available in the best time complexity.
ALGORITHMS:
The program follows algorithms of Floyd Warshell (Dynamic Programming), and Time Scheduling (Greedy Algorithm). 
The Floyd warshell algorithm is used for locating the best possible path to the destination point. In this algorithm, the graph storing the weights(distance) between two nodes(two places) is processed to find the shortest path for all the destinations to reach from source node. 
Time Scheduling algorithm is used for the places that are time bound for visiting places that you want to visit before them getting closed.
